The Meteor site from my DrupalCamp Oslo presentation about Drupal and Meteor: http://oslo2013.drupalcamp.no/program/integration-teach-drupal-to-ride-the-meteor.

This is just a regular Meteor site. I configure Accounts a little bit and add a Meteor method to be called from the Drupal end, but there is no deep magic going on. I hope eventually to develop a Meteor package for Drupal integration that provides some methods out of the box (and which the Drupal module calls).
